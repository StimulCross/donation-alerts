## Thanks

These packages are heavily inspired by [Twurple](https://github.com/twurple/twurple/) project, right down to the smallest detail. Big thanks to [@d-fischer](https://github.com/d-fischer) for creating an awesome [Twurple](https://github.com/twurple/twurple/) project and many other tools used in this project.
